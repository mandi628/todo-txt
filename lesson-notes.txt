2024.08.01 Ruby did really well on review. Calliope is coming along - 100 for next time.
2024.08.01 Luke is doing better with focus. He is working on staying with it through a whole Twinkle. PP, ICC, & DBUB.
2024.08.01 Eirene did a good job, but her sponge is uncomfortable. I looked for anything else in my stash, and couldn't find it. PP, ICC, & DBUB.
2024.08.01 Beatrix & LucyJean are working on 100 ICC for next week, plus 5 DBUB cards and 5 PC cards. Sounding good, but still working on posture reminders.
